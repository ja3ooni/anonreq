# Phase 15 Test Plan: Deployment Models

## Unit Tests

- Pydantic validation rejects malformed configuration and accepts documented examples.
- Service-level decisions are deterministic for the same input and config version.
- Error mapping returns the documented HTTP status and structured error body.
- Metrics helpers reject unbounded label values.
- Audit payload builders enforce the metadata-only allowlist.

## Integration Tests

- Authenticated tenant-scoped requests exercise all OpenAPI endpoints: GET /health, GET /metrics, GET /v1/admin/deployment/status, POST /v1/admin/deployment/preflight.
- Dependency outage scenarios return fail-secure 503/500 responses with zero provider forwards.
- Durable records are written with hashes, IDs, counts, and timestamps only.
- RBAC denies callers without the required role and emits `authz_denied`.
- Multi-tenant concurrent execution confirms no cross-tenant read, write, metric, or audit leak.

## Property Tests

- For generated tenant IDs, session IDs, actor IDs, and policy inputs, decisions remain tenant-scoped and never include raw generated sensitive strings in logs.
- For generated failure injection points, provider forward count remains zero unless all preconditions pass.
- For generated config permutations, deny actions dominate allow actions when policies conflict.

## Load Tests

- K6 scenarios run at baseline, burst, and soak profiles with latency budgets tied to the master SLOs.
- Queue, cache, and database pressure produce controlled backpressure instead of unsanitized forwarding.
- Metrics remain bounded in cardinality under randomized tenant and request IDs.

## Security Tests

- docker compose health within 60 seconds.
- helm template and kubeconform validation.
- Valkey sentinel failover window.
- transparent proxy unsupported schema policy.
- air-gap install without network.
- No raw prompt, raw response, token string, original entity value, secret, or internal endpoint appears in logs, traces, metrics, UI JSON, or exports.
- All administrative endpoints require authentication and correct role authorization.

## Acceptance Tests

- Required audit events are emitted: deployment_preflight_failed, deployment_profile_changed, tls_interception_enabled, upgrade_started, upgrade_completed.
- Required metrics are present: anonreq_readiness_state, anonreq_startup_preflight_seconds, anonreq_proxy_passthrough_total, anonreq_upgrade_events_total.
- OpenAPI schema validates and SDK contract tests remain green.
- Security acceptance gates in `15-SECURITY-ACCEPTANCE.md` pass without exception.
